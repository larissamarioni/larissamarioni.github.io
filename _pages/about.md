I am a Principal Economist at the [National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR)](https://niesr.ac.uk/), a Research Associate at the [Economic Statistics Centre of Excellence (ESCoE)](https://www.escoe.ac.uk/), a Research Associate at [The Productivity Institute (TPI)](https://www.productivity.ac.uk/) and a [UKRI Policy Fellow Alumni](https://www.ukri.org/publications/policy-fellow-database-of-fellows/). I specialise in applied microeconomics and data analysis. My research interest lies primarily in labour economics, productivity and public policy. I hold a PhD in Economics from the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/).

I have extensive experience applying quantitative methods to investigate a wide range of economic matters and conducting comprehensive analyses of economic data. Over the years, I have worked on several research projects funded by esteemed organisations such as ESRC, UKRI, ONS, Cabinet Office, NIC, BEIS, DSIT, DIT, Defra, DfE, and the Scottish Government.
